# Puppy-Restaurant
multi-page puppy website

The Puppy Restaurant website was made using html, css, and bootstrap.

Alex Ato created the skeleton of each webpage, consisting of a head and footer, and initialized the repository for the group.

Alex, Carlos and Trevor each developed seperate webpages while following a prototype given to them through Adobe XD.

Webpage responsiveness for all screen sizes was added to each webpage.

Changes made were updated through seperate branches in GitHub, eventually merging into the main file to complete the assignment.
